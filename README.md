# Image-Encryption-and-FFT
This repository demonstrates image encryption using noise addition and XOR operations based on a user-defined key. It also showcases the use of FFT to process images in the frequency domain, with results stored in a GZIP-compressed format. The image can be reconstructed via inverse FFT, providing a secure method for image processing.
